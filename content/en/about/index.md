I’m Alfonso, a Mexican data engineer 🇲🇽. I’ve been interested in technology for as long as I can remember. It wasn’t until university that I started programming in my free time, and I eventually formalized my studies with a Master’s degree in Computer Science. I’m passionate about data processing and the flow of information, though I’m also interested in artificial intelligence systems. I’m a strong advocate for reproducibility in systems and consider it a key part of developing any kind of solution. Some other ideas I resonate with are:
- Software development as a _social process_.
- Quality over quantity.
- [Not every problem requires the same tool.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument)
- Several of the principles from [The Grug Brained Developer](https://grugbrain.dev/).
